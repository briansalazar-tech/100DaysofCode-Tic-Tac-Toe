# 100 Days of Code Day 84: Tic-Tac-Toe CLI Game
Tic Tac Toe program that was created as part of the 100 Days of code course.

The program is split into two files. The game allows players to choose what symbol they want to use, alternates turns when a game is over and keeps track of how many times each player has one to add an element of replayability to the game.
